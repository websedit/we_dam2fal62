Known Problems
==============

Maybe there were not all files indexed by the Scheduler Task, File Abstratcion Layer: Update storage index, then you have to click on all folders in Filelist manually to index the files.

Files with umlauts in the filename are not imported. That can cause the import to stop and it will not get ahead further. So mark these database entrys with damalreadyexported = 1.
