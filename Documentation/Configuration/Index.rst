Configuration
=============

You have to install the Advanced file metadata (filemetadata). After installation of the filemetadata extension, index your files.

You don't need to implement any TypoScript.

The extension uses Jquery and Jquery UI. Both libraries are provided at the Default Layout file at the extension folder.

After the files and relations have been imported by DAM2FAL 6.2 uninstall the DAM extensions.

You have also to rewrite your DAM related extensions that you can use them with FAL.

The extension is available in german and in english.
